This project aims to compare 3 ML models (Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, & Latent Dirichlet Allocation).

It compares these three models in two ways divided into two folders: With chatTime as a feature and WITHOUT chatTime as a feature.

The process in each folder is the same: run preprocessing.ipynb -> run model_training.ipynb -> run model_analysis.ipynb

In feature_comparison/, run compare.ipynb to compare the results of with/without chatTime.
